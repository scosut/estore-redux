# E-Store 

This application offers an eâ€‘commece storefront for shoppers to purchase electronic goods. Shoppers can add items to their carts, submit product reviews, proceed through the checkout process, and track the status of completed orders. Administrators can update order delivery progress and manage their inventory by adding, modifying, or deleting products.

### Applied Technologies: 
- React, Router, and Redux perform conditional component rendering, site navigation, and state management. 
- Reactstrap applies component-level styling.
- Fetch API coordinates requests from client to server. 
- PHP and MySQL define REST API with endpoints and methods for shuttling data to and from the server.
